## Hello World!

Welcome to Fluid! Venturing a place that AI has never dared to touch, prod.

Fluid works by letting AI work on sandbox replicas of infrastructure, not prod itself. Letting AI run rampant and complete a task without you having to worry if it's bringing down your whole environment.

The full functionality of a terminal agent like Claude Code but working on your infrastructure. At the end you get a nice IaC like an Ansible Playbook to audit and then apply to prod, just like you are used to.

The future will be sandbox rich. Giving agents environments to learn, build, test, try things, and explore.
