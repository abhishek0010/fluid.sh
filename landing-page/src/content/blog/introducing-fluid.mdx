## Hello World!

Welcome to Fluid!

## What is it?

Fluid is a terminal agent venturing into prod. A place that AI has never dared to touch. Like Claude Code but for working on infrastructure.

## How does it work?

Fluid works by letting AI work on sandbox replicas of infrastructure, not prod itself. Think like replicas of VMs, Kubernetes clusters, etc. Letting AI run safely and complete a task without you having to worry if it's bringing down your whole environment.

For auditability and review, the agent will generate a nice Infrastructure as Code (IaC) like an Ansible Playbook for you to audit and then apply to prod, just like you are used to.

## Why now?

Claude Code and similar terminal agents took the world by storm for their increased productivity and autonomous features. The same is now happening to infrastructure roles with the help of sandboxing.

Fluid can fix on-call issues, restart services, debug memory problems, all without the engineer having to worry. There has never been more code in the world than there is now and I don't see that stopping anytime soon.

We will always need infrastructure support to run our code whether AI or human.


## How did you come up with the idea?

This was a problem that I had and I wanted to share it. I wanted AI to help with my infrastructure work like Claude Code did with my code.
